Kemal is `Database Agnostic`. It doesn't enforce any database and / or libraries.

However here are some suggested libraries that you can use

- [crystal-db](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db): Common DB API for Crystal. Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.
- [crecto](https://github.com/fridgerator/crecto): Database wrapper for Crystal, inspired by Ecto.
- [topaz](https://github.com/topaz-crystal/topaz): A simple and useful db wrapper.

Please check the relevant repo for samples and more info.
